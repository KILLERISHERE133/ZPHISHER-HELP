Bitcoins Essay
1371 Words  | 3 Pages
...nclusion, I believe that Bitcoin is the way of the future, but people have not had very much experience with cryptographic currencies yet. This currency is new to everyone, and I believe that because there is a limited supply, that one day even a very small amount will be worth more than we can imagine today. I myself have invested in Bitcoin, I invested when Bitcoin was worth around $85/BTC, and although I only invested $25 you can imagine that today I am kicking myself for not investing more back then. At one point, my $25 investment was worth $308. If I had invested my entire savings in Bitcoin back then and then sold it while Bitcoin was at its peak I wouldn’t have to be in school today. Alas, I believe one day my 0.28 BTC will one day be worth a lot of money, I plan on continually purchasing more Bitcoins and maybe one day passing on my Bitcoins to my children.

Crypto-Currencies Essay
1267 Words  | 3 Pages
...global organizations, demographics and communities are responsible for the large success of the many crypto-currencies on the digital market today. From my discovery of crypto-currencies in late 2013, I have discovered a major trade community with the international population. The crypto-currencies are growing largely in size and popularity. I am concerned over the stability of crypto-currencies - many of types currencies have suffered major capital loss, decrease of market cap, theft, illegal trade etc.. These certain currencies could be a hazardous to deal with in the future. I believe trade and transaction of crypto-currencies should be encouraged on a local, national and global level. Although they have suffered major setbacks in the global economy, I maintain that crypto-currencies have a positive future and that they will undoubtedly affect the worlds economy.

The Future of Our Money
2427 Words  | 5 Pages
The invention of money is perhaps one of the greatest achievements of human civilization. From the very beginning of society, people have used money to circumvent the difficulties of bartering and to foster trade and commerce. Since then, money has come a long way. No longer do we need to rely on silver coins, cocoa beans, or even anything of intrinsic value to conduct our business; today, we use paper currency, which is convenient and easy to carry around. But slowly, we are moving into the digital age of money, an age in which less of our money is actually tangible and more of it is just data on a computer server. To some, this prospect may seem daunting. However, given the major advantages of electronic money over outmoded paper counterpart, society as a whole should embrace the upcoming era of digital money.
